# Python Coding Excercise

## Phase 1
Write a python script that takes one or more filenames on standard input.
Read each file as a sequence of numbers, one per line. For each file,
calculate the count, sum, max, and average for all values in the file. Print
the filename along with the results to standard output. Some example files are
provided.

## Phase 2
Create a pytest suite that can be used to test your script with the
input files provided.
